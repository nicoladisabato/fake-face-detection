# Real vs Fake face detection with Keras

In this project I developed a Jupiter notebook where I analyzed the "140k Real and Fake Faces" dataset on Kaggle and I fine-tuned the DenseNet CNN model using Keras achieving a 0.97 accuracy. 

Please like my [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nicoladisabato/fake-face-detection-with-keras-accuracy-0-97) on Kaggle it if you found it helpful:
